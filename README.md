# HypoTest
Program for hypothesis testing on TI calculators\
The reason this is on GitHub is because I'm still fixing bugs/errors and I might want to add features.\
Currently, we can do 7 different hypothesis tests:
1.  One-sample z test for μ (σ known)
2.  One-sample t test for μ
3.  Two-sample z test for μ (σ known)
4.  Two-sample t test for μ
5.  One-sample z test for p
6.  Two-sample z test for p when H<sub>0</sub> is not p<sub>1</sub>=p<sub>2</sub>
7.  Two-sample z test for p when H<sub>0</sub> is p<sub>1</sub>=p<sub>2</sub>
## Installation
The 3 files initially used have been reduced to one file, [Hypotest_1file.8xp]. Download it and use a TI connection software, such as TI-Connect CE, to transfer it to a connected calculator. The name of the program on the calculator is "HYPOTEST".
## Features to add
* Creating confidence intervals
* Showing test statistic formulae
* Asking for H<sub>a</sub> instead of how many tails
* Visualising distributions with `ShadeNorm` and `Shade_t`
* Adding Hypothesis tests using Χ<sup>2</sup>
