# HypoTest
Program for hypothesis testing on TI calculators\
The reason this is on GitHub is because I'm still fixing bugs/errors and I might want to add features.
## Hypothesis Testing Program
Currently, we can do 7 different hypothesis tests:
1.  One-sample z test for μ (σ known)
2.  One-sample t test for μ
3.  Two-sample z test for μ (σ known)
4.  Two-sample t test for μ
5.  One-sample z test for p
6.  Two-sample z test for p when H<sub>0</sub> is not p<sub>1</sub>=p<sub>2</sub>
7.  Two-sample z test for p when H<sub>0</sub> is p<sub>1</sub>=p<sub>2</sub>
## Confidence Interval Program
This program will make a confidence interval for µ or p (1 or 2 populations).
## Installation
The programs on this branch are only compatible with the other programs on this same branch. In order to run them, the Initiate program must be run first when installed. So, to use both the Hypothesis Test and Confidence Interval Program,
1. Go to the "add-confidence-interval" branch of this repository. (this branch)
2. Download the three .8xp files
3. Transfer them to your calculator via a TI connection software, such as TI-Connect CE.
4. Run the program titled "INIT". It can be deleted if desired at this point, however it must be run in the case of a RAM reset.
5. Use the other two programs as you like.
## Features to add
The following features may be added at some point in the future:
* Showing test statistic and confidence interval formulae
* Fleshing out the Options menu under the π special menu
* Asking for H<sub>a</sub> instead of how many tails
* Visualising distributions with `ShadeNorm` and `Shade_t`
* Adding Hypothesis tests using Χ<sup>2</sup>
